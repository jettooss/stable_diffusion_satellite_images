It is designed to train models on custom satellite image datasets, enabling the creation of realistic images for various applications such as environmental monitoring and urban planning.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Generation:** Create detailed satellite images from textual descriptions.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Split large images and masks into manageable 512x512 pixel sections and filter based on annotation quality thresholds.
- **LoRA Integration:** Enhance Stable Diffusion models efficiently with minimal computational overhead.
- **Advanced Augmentation:** Apply sophisticated data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness and performance.
- **YOLO Integration:** Utilize the YOLO object detection model for accurate identification of unauthorized activities in generated images.
- **Continuous Operation:** A seamlessly running video demonstration showcasing the project in action.

## Technologies Used

- **Stable Diffusion:** For generating high-resolution synthetic satellite images.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** To efficiently fine-tune large models.
- **YOLOv8:** Real-time object detection to identify specific features in satellite images.
